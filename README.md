NeoMatrix-FastLED-IR
====================
This is a combined example code that does neopixel animations _while_ listening for IR commands (given a capable enough chip)
and while animating a neopixel matrix.

This is a fork of https://github.com/marcmerlin/FastLED-IR and adds FastLED-Neomatrix code

It uses these libraries
